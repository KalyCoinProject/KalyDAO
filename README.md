- **Treasury Management**: Control treasury funds through governance decisions
- **KLC Wrapping**: Wrap native KLC to governance tokens (gKLC) for participation
- **Vote History**: Track voting history for transparency and accountability
- **Markdown Support**: Rich text formatting for proposal descriptions

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Blockchain Interaction**: wagmi, viem, RainbowKit
- **Data Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: React hooks and context
